The complexity of the design may influence the overall processing time. After processing, the shipping time depends on the delivery location. For domestic orders, delivery usually takes between 6 and 8 business days. For international shipments, delivery can take anywhere from 1 to 2 weeks, depending on the destination and the shipping method chosen.

            Shipping fees are calculated based on the selected delivery method.
