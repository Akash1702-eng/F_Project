            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Our Wishlist feature is designed to enhance your shopping experience by allowing you to save your favorite garments and custom designs for future reference or purchase. Whether you’re still deciding on the perfect garment, waiting for stock to be replenished, or hoping for a special discount, the Wishlist enables you to keep track of items you're interested in without needing to make an immediate purchase. This feature is especially useful for customers who like to carefully consider their choices or who wish to create a collection of items to compare later.

            To add an item to your Wishlist, simply navigate to the product page of the garment or design you're interested in, and click on the “Add to Wishlist” button. This action will save the item to your Wishlist without requiring you to add it to your cart. You can continue browsing and adding more items as needed. Whether it's a custom-designed garment or a ready-made item, each product can be easily added to your Wishlist. For custom garments, you can save your unique designs, including any logos, text, or other personalization options, so that they’re readily available when you’re ready to complete the order.

            Your Wishlist is accessible at any time by logging into your account and clicking the “Wishlist” link, usually located in the top navigation bar. This page will display all the items you've saved, making it easy to view your preferred garments and designs in one place. The Wishlist helps you keep track of what you like and want to purchase later, without cluttering your cart or losing track of items across multiple browsing sessions. If you change your mind or no longer wish to keep an item in your Wishlist, you can simply remove it at any time with a single click.

            We understand that customers want to stay updated on their Wishlist items, especially when they’re waiting for a sale or stock update. That's why we provide notifications to alert you if any item on your Wishlist goes on sale, becomes available in your size, or is restocked. You will receive an email or, if applicable, an app notification about these changes—ensuring you never miss an opportunity to purchase your saved items at the best possible price.

            The Wishlist is not just for keeping track of standard products. For custom garments, it allows you to save detailed preferences, including any modifications to designs such as logos, messages, colors, or sizes. This means that if you're not ready to make the final purchase, you can return to the design later, making it easy to finalize when you're prepared to move forward with your order.
